node_Project4
=============
This is a continuation of my Project_4 repo that I have found here: https://github.com/jdfenwick/Project_4
In case you are wondering (which I'm sure you are), I was having issues on my main machine with the virtual machine running on 
the proper port, so I made a new repo, copied my files over to my laptop and now everything works fine (weird isn't it?).
Then I couldn't get it to commit to that repo from this machine and I got fed up with it THUS the new repo.

Individual count for Happy words and Sad words doesn't work properly. Can't figure out what I need to do to fix it properly.
